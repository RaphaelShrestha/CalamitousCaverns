# Calamitous Caverns


**Senior Year Practicum Project | Unreal Engine 5.4.4**

**Calamitous Caverns** is a first-person Unreal Engine 5 game I designed and produced throughout my senior year of high school. Built in UE5.4.4, the project explores replication, session systems, level streaming, and core gameplay loops while delivering a playable multiplayer prototype.

## üéÆ Features
- **Mining System**: Dynamic ore generation, pickaxe quality checks, and mining UI.  
- **Inventory & Economy**: Hotbar system, buy/sell shops, and receipts.  
- **Quota System**: Scaling formula tied to the day/night cycle.  
- **Day/Night Cycle**: Rotating sun with gameplay effects.  
- **Multiplayer**: UE5 listen server sessions, replication, and RPCs.  
- **Optimization**: Level streaming for seamless travel and reduced RAM usage.

## Acknowledgments
I want to thank **Kekdot** on YouTube ‚Äî his tutorials on Unreal Engine multiplayer concepts helped me understand replication and session systems, which I then applied to build my own implementation in Calamitous Caverns.
