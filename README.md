**Senior Year Practicum Project | Unreal Engine 5.4.4**

Built in Unreal Engine 5.4.4 using Blueprints only, this project focuses on tech and tooling. I set up listen server multiplayer with the UE session system, used replicated actors and variables, and implemented RPCs for inventory updates, mining events, and quota changes. Level Streaming plus Seamless Travel manage cave sublevels to reduce memory. UI was built with UMG widgets for inventory, hotbar, shop, and quota, with GameState driving the day and night cycle and exposing time to clients.

### Features
- **Mining System**: Dynamic ore generation, pickaxe quality checks, and mining UI.  
- **Inventory & Economy**: Hotbar system, buy/sell shops, and receipts.  
- **Quota System**: Scaling formula tied to the day/night cycle.  
- **Day/Night Cycle**: Rotating sun with gameplay effects.  
- **Multiplayer**: UE5 listen server sessions, replication, and RPCs.  
- **Optimization**: Level streaming for seamless travel and reduced RAM usage.

### Acknowledgments
I learned core UE networking concepts from **Cedric Neukirchenâ€™s Multiplayer Network Compendium**. It helped me understand replication, RPC patterns, and session workflows, which I applied in this project.
